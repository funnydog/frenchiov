## The Frenchiov Collection

A collection of perl scripts for irssi with the following features:

 * A markov chain text generator, trained on the channel logs.
 * An obsolete url shortener using goo.gl
 * A potential RSS reader left unfinished.
 * A boring adventure game that responds to private messages.

## Motivation

This is a dump of old code I'll never use any longer published for
historical reasons.

## Installation

Put a script in .irssi/scripts and run it with the command

```/script load <script-name>```

## License

## Disclaimer

Any reference to real facts or persons is purely coincidental and the
sole result of a work of fiction.

No animals were harmed in the making of the scripts.

Haters gonna hate.
